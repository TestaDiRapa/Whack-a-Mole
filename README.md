# Whack-a-Mole
A Medical Imaging project for skin lesion segmentation. The three approaches proposed (COCOAW, IDC and MoleNet) are described in the Whack-a-Mole.pdf file.

# Running the system
The system is based on Python 3.7. All the required libraries are listed in the "requirements.txt" file. <br>
After running the "server.py" file, the interface can be accessed at localhost:8080

## Weights
The size of the pre-trained weights for the neural network exceeded the 100Mb limit set by GitHub. They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L0fWA-F0L3XmgXKIQLdaUVwnuOscupIj/view?usp=sharing) and must be put in the "molenet" folder.
